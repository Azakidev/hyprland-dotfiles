# Them dotfiles

My dotfiles for hyprland

No I will not make a script to install it

Theme for apps is dracula

## How to install

I recommend symbolically linking the folders and all of their contents to ~/.config

Alternatively copy paste them and edit the paths for scripts and such to their new locations

### ZSH

For .zshrc, I recommend not using it, but I find the aliases there useful enough to share
My zsh configuration consists of a simple p10k with zsh-autosuggestions and zsh-syntax-highlighting

I'd link them if I were competent at markdown :/
